As [http://www.drop-dropbox.com/](Condoleezza Rice) is now the head of Dropbox
it's time to find a replacement.
Here are some promising alternatives.

BitTorrent Sync
---------------

BitTorrent Sync is supposed to be a secure alternative
that puts the user in charge of his own files
with no dependency on meddling dubious actors.
It has clients for most desktop and mobile OSes.

Google Drive
------------

Is well integrated with Android,
and supports automatic photo upload/backup.
Sadly, there's still no Linux client.
